                        Intelligent and passionate, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer
                        and
                        Marge,
                        the younger sister of Bart, and the older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and
                        liberal
                        political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age;Lisa is a vegetarian,
                        a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and
                        a

                        TLisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian
                        in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a
                        variety of political causes which usually sets her against most of the people in Springfield.

                        boyfriend, such as Edmund Dracula in "Treehouse of Horror XXI" or Colin from "The Simpson's
                        Movie".

                        Mr. Burns' trademark expression is the word "Excellent", muttered slowly in a low, sinister
                        voice while steepling his fingertips. He occasionally orders Smithers to "release the
                        hounds", so as to let his vicious guard dogs attack any intruders, enemies or even invited
                        guests. Mr. Burns is Springfield's richest and most-powerful citizen (and also the richest
                        person in Springfield's state;

                        wildly depending on the episode). He uses his power and wealth to do whatever he wants,
                        usually without regard for consequences and without interference from the authorities. These
                        qualities led Wizard magazine to rate him the 45th-greatest villain of all time.
